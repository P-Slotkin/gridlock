#Gridlock

##MVP

This game involves having many blocks on a board. The goal of the game is to move one block from one side of the board to the other, by moving other blocks out of the way.

###Minimal Features Required
- board
- blocks
- levels
- user interaction to select and move blocks
- move counter (compares how many moves player took vs the perfect player)
- music
- instructions

I will most likely not use React and make the game with JS, HTML and CSS. One of the biggest challenges I foresee is utilizing blocks of different lengths. This might be able to be solved by spawning the blocks on one space, but assigning the adjacent spaces as filled.
