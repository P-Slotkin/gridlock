#Gridlock

##MVP

This game involves having many blocks on a board. The goal of the game is to move one block from one side of the board to the other, by moving other blocks out of the way.

###Minimal Features Required
- board
- blocks
- levels
- user interaction to select and move blocks
- move counter (compares how many moves player took vs the perfect player)
- music
- instructions

I will most likely use React to make the game. A couple of the biggest challenges I foresee are utilizing blocks of different lengths and using blocks that face different directions. This might be able to be solved by spawning the blocks on one space, but assigning the adjacent spaces as filled.
